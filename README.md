# Great Uni Hack 2020

Natural disasters kill on average 60,000 people per year globally (Ritchie & Roser, 2019). But a lot of these deaths couldâ€™ve been prevented if people were better informed about the natural events around them

During the great uni hack 2020, we worked together to develop an app that summarizes different sources of data and helps users stay safe from different natural catastrophes. The technologies we used were Django and Vue.js with Quasar.

Our website lets users: 
* Visualize natural disasters both past and present, including wildfires and earthquakes. 
* It is integrated with NASA api, showing you natural catastrophes that are happening right now around the world
* There is also Twitter and news feed integration which allows users to easily track the situation around them
* The app also allows you to search for a specific city, and check the local air quality information 
* In addition, users can also get location-specific information on reported fires and Air quality status.
